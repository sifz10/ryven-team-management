   - Stores all GitHub events: pushes, PRs, issues, reviews, etc.

2. **Models**
   - `GitHubLog` model with relationships and helper methods
   - Updated `Employee` model with `githubLogs()` relationship

3. **Controller**
   - `GitHubWebhookController` - Handles all GitHub webhook events
   - Supports: push, pull_request, pull_request_review, issues, and more

4. **Routes**
   - `/webhook/github` - Public webhook endpoint for GitHub
   - Employee profile with GitHub tab: `/employees/{id}?tab=github`

5. **Views**
   - New "GitHub Activity" tab in employee profile
   - Beautiful activity timeline with statistics
   - Matches your brand colors (black primary, modern rounded design)
   - Fully responsive and dark mode compatible

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
2. **Payload URL**: `https://team.ryven.co/webhook/github`
3. **Content type**: application/json
4. **Events**: Select these:
   - ✅ Pushes
   - ✅ Pull requests
   - ✅ Pull request reviews
   - ✅ Issues
   - ✅ Branch or tag creation
5. Click "Add webhook"

### Step 2: Match Employees

The system matches GitHub activities to employees by **email address**. 

**Important**: Employee email in your system must match their GitHub commit email.

### Step 3: View Activities

1. Go to any employee profile
2. Click the "GitHub Activity" tab
3. See all their GitHub activities with beautiful stats!

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

- **📤 Pushes**: Commits, branch name, commit messages
- **🔀 Pull Requests**: PRs opened, closed, merged
- **👀 Reviews**: PR reviews and comments
- **🐛 Issues**: Issues created and comments
- **🌱 Branches**: Branch/tag creation and deletion

## 🎨 Beautiful UI Features

- **Statistics Cards**: Total activities, commits, PRs, repositories
- **Activity Timeline**: Chronological list with rich details
- **Event Badges**: Color-coded event types
- **Repository Links**: Direct links to GitHub
- **Commit Details**: SHA, messages, and links
- **PR Status**: Open, closed, merged with colored badges
- **Empty State**: Helpful setup instructions when no data
